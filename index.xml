The general design intent of having two verification engines, is that it should make the whole platform more reliable.
j-Ecdar The intention of j-Ecdar is to be a form of reference implementation, where no effort is put into optimizing the code for speed, but rather for
Correctness Readability Reveaal The intention of the Reveaal engine is to get a verification engine that is fast and parallelizable.</description></item><item><title>Developers</title><link>/developers/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/developers/</guid><description>Developers that have contributed to the project over time

Uppaal TIGA versions - 2010 - 2013 The first version of the tool (0.6 to 0.10) (http://people.cs.aau.dk/~adavid/ecdar/ - defunct webpage) was based on the GUI and verification engine of Uppaal TIGA. Efter this it was released as part of Uppaal TIGA in version 0.17.
These versions all had the problem that the GUI was designed for the Uppaal TIGA semantics and thus did not match the Ecdar Timed Input/Output Automata (TIOA) semantics.</description></item><item><title>Edgar</title><link>/edgar/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/edgar/</guid><description>Edgar the diamond squirrel is here to help you remember that the tool is pronounced Ecdar and not Edgar.</description></item></channel></rss>
